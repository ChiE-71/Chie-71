## Hey there 👋

I'm ChiE, a chemist based in Brunei Darussalam.

I love building what I imagine, which is why I'm diving into the world of coding.

### About Me

- Started learning to code in 2022
- Currently learning React ⚛️
- Gaming enthusiast: big fan of Slay The Spire

### What I’m Doing

I’m exploring frontend development, building small projects, and experimenting with ideas that combine logic, creativity, and problem-solving.

### Fun Fact

Even as a chemist, I find coding to be a new kind of chemistry – joining building block (code, ~atoms~) to create something that works beautifully.
